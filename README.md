# Thrust-Vectoring-Control

The best combination of a nozzle's flap angles that allows the engine outlet flow to be directed at a certain specified angle and achieves maximum thrust at the same time is to be found. Different combinations of flap angles for each required outlet flow angle were tried, the calculated thrust value for each combination was plotted, and the one that results in maximum thrust was determined.
